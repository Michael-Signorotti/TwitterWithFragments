# Project 4 - *Twitter with Fragments*

**Twitter with Fragments** is an Android app that allows users to view their home and mentions timelines in a tabbed interface. Users can also compose and post tweets as well as view the profiles and timelines of others. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index).

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

  * [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limiting) in place.
